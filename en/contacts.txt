11:T474,Currently, I use some of my free time for coding and I love using VSCode <3 sometimes I will even save some of my test projects or ideas on Github or a private GitLab.
For example, all of the codebase for this website is on my Github page! It is written in React.js with a combination of HTML/CSS/Typscript using the Node.js runtime to build and publish everything.
Back in the days, I would participate in Global Game Jam from 2015 to 2020 with friends, but now I focus on the Zig language which seemed really appealing as soon as I started using it. I even decided to build my own 2D game engine following a youtube series as a way to learn more on how it works. The original series is written with Java but I tried to recreate everything in Zig as a practical exercise, maybe one day I'll even publish it on GitHub too... :D
I am in love with Zig language, as a cross-platform engine that compiles against C/C++, not to mention uses very lightweight keywords which makes it easy to understand what's going on and is still in development. It's something that combines both the good things of C/C++ and the Node.js/Typescript environments.f:["$","$L10",null,{"locale":"en","now":"$D2025-01-10T14:53:31.108Z","timeZone":"Europe/Paris","messages":{"not_found_page":{"description":"Page not found :/"},"navbar":{"musics_lbl":"Musics","devinfos_lbl":"Coding","contacts_lbl":"Contacts","legals_lbl":"Legals"},"home":{"welcome":"Hi everybody !\nWelcome to my personal page !\n♥ :3 ♥","main_intro":"I would say that I have 2 (okay ... maybe 3) main passions.\nFirst one is music ♫♪\nSecond one is coding and creating apps like this website for example !\n(Third one is video-games but I won't talk about that particulary here)","musics_infos":"Soooo ...\nMy first passion is music and I love to produce ♥\nYou can find my artist profile under the nickname 'Ilohama' on different streaming platforms.\nClick on the button right below for the links !","music_link":"My Music Page","dev_infos":"And my second passion is programming and computer sciences.\nI have studied and worked in this field.\nI'll let you learn more on this by clicking on the button below !","dev_link":"My Devs Infos"},"musics":{"header":"My Music","desc":"Here's a list of links to my profile pages on different streaming platforms ...\nChoose the one you're the most used to :>","releases_lbl":"My Releases"},"dev_infos":{"header":"My Dev Journey","grades":{"lbl":"Studies & Graduations","beginning_lbl":"The Beginning","beginning_desc":"As far as I remember, ever since I was young I would disassemble electronic devices to see all the little pieces and was constantly asking myself : \"How does this work ?\".\nSo, when it came as a class in school, I naturally jumped to study Electronic Science and finally understand everything I had been questioning.

I used to code the container with C/C++ in combination of gStreamer for data flow. Then, to display them to the final consumer, the player used Node.Js and electron/Vue.Js for creating the GUI.
