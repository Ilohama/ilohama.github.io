For example, all of the codebase for this website is on my Github page! It is written in React.js with a combination of HTML/CSS/Typscript using the Node.js runtime to build and publish everything.
Back in the days, I would participate in Global Game Jam from 2015 to 2020 with friends, but now I focus on the Zig language which seemed really appealing as soon as I started using it. I even decided to build my own 2D game engine following a youtube series as a way to learn more on how it works. The original series is written with Java but I tried to recreate everything in Zig as a practical exercise, maybe one day I'll even publish it on GitHub too... :D
I am in love with Zig language, as a cross-platform engine that compiles against C/C++, not to mention uses very lightweight keywords which makes it easy to understand what's going on and is still in development. It's something that combines both the good things of C/C++ and the Node.js/Typescript environments.6:["$","main",null,{"className":"page_content_container","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"flex flex-row items-center mt-2 align-text-bottom text-4xl font-futuristic","children":[["$","svg",null,{"stroke":"currentColor","fill":"currentColor","strokeWidth":"0","viewBox":"0 0 640 512","className":"hidden md:block mr-4","children":["$undefined",[["$","path","0",{"d":"M278.9 511.5l-61-17.7c-6.4-1.8-10-8.5-8.2-14.9L346.2 8.7c1.8-6.4 8.5-10 14.9-8.2l61 17.7c6.4 1.8 10 8.5 8.2 14.9L293.8 503.3c-1.9 6.4-8.5 10.1-14.9 8.2zm-114-112.2l43.5-46.4c4.6-4.9 4.3-12.7-.8-17.2L117 256l90.6-79.7c5.1-4.5 5.5-12.3.8-17.2l-43.5-46.4c-4.5-4.8-12.1-5.1-17-.5L3.8 247.2c-5.1 4.7-5.1 12.8 0 17.5l144.1 135.1c4.9 4.6 12.5 4.4 17-.5zm327.2.6l144.1-135.1c5.1-4.7 5.1-12.8 0-17.5L492.1 112.1c-4.8-4.5-12.4-4.3-17 .5L431.6 159c-4.6 4.9-4.3 12.7.8 17.2L523 256l-90.6 79.7c-5.1 4.5-5.5 12.3-.8 17.2l43.5 46.4c4.5 4.9 12.1 5.1 17 .6z","children":[]}]]],"style":{"color":"$undefined"},"height":"1em","width":"1em","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"}],"My Dev Journey",["$","svg",null,{"stroke":"currentColor","fill":"currentColor","strokeWidth":"0","viewBox":"0 0 640 512","className":"hidden md:block ml-4","children":["$undefined",[["$","path","0",{"d":"M278.9 511.5l-61-17.7c-6.4-1.8-10-8.5-8.2-14.9L346.2 8.7c1.8-6.4 8.5-10 14.9-8.2l61 17.7c6.4 1.8 10 8.5 8.2 14.9L293.8 503.3c-1.9 6.4-8.5 10.1-14.9 8.2zm-114-112.2l43.5-46.4c4.6-4.9 4.3-12.7-.8-17.2L117 256l90.6-79.7c5.1-4.5 5.5-12.3.8-17.2l-43.5-46.4c-4.5-4.8-12.1-5.1-17-.5L3.8 247.2c-5.1 4.7-5.1 12.8 0 17.5l144.1 135.1c4.9 4.6 12.5 4.4 17-.5zm327.2.6l144.1-135.1c5.1-4.7 5.1-12.8 0-17.5L492.1 112.1c-4.8-4.5-12.4-4.3-17 .5L431.6 159c-4.6 4.9-4.3 12.7.8 17.2L523 256l-90.6 79.7c-5.1 4.5-5.5 12.3-.8 17.2l43.5 46.4c4.5 4.9 12.1 5.1 17 .6z","children":[]}]]],"style":{"color":"$undefined"},"height":"1em","width":"1em","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"}]]}],["$","hr",null,{"className":"separator_secondary"}],["$","$Le",null,{"title":[["$","svg",null,{"stroke":"currentColor","fill":"currentColor","strokeWidth":"0","viewBox":"0 0 640 512","className":"mr-4","children":["$undefined",[["$","path","0",{"d":"M622.34 153.2L343.4 67.5c-15.2-4.67-31.6-4.67-46.79 0L17.66 153.2c-23.54 7.23-23.54 38.36 0 45.59l48.63 14.94c-10.67 13.19-17.23 29.28-17.88 46.9C38.78 266.15 32 276.11 32 288c0 10.78 5.68 19.85 13.86 25.65L20.33 428.53C18.11 438.52 25.71 448 35.94 448h56.11c10.24 0 17.84-9.48 15.62-19.47L82.14 313.65C90.32 307.85 96 298.78 96 288c0-11.57-6.47-21.25-15.66-26.87.76-15.02 8.44-28.3 20.69-36.72L296.6 284.5c9.06 2.78 26.44 6.25 46.79 0l278.95-85.7c23.55-7.24 23.55-38.36 0-45.6zM352.79 315.09c-28.53 8.76-52.84 3.92-65.59 0l-145.02-44.55L128 384c0 35.35 85.96 64 192 64s192-28.65 192-64l-14.18-113.47-145.03 44.56z","children":[]}]]],"style":{"color":"$undefined"},"height":"1em","width":"1em","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"}],"Studies & Graduations"],"children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"small_header_text_block","children":["The Beginning"," :"]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text_block","children":"As far as I remember, ever since I was young I would disassemble electronic devices to see all the little pieces and was constantly asking myself : \"How does this work ?\".\nSo, when it came as a class in school, I naturally jumped to study Electronic Science and finally understand everything I had been questioning.

I used to code the container with C/C++ in combination of gStreamer for data flow. Then, to display them to the final consumer, the player used Node.Js and electron/Vue.Js for creating the GUI.

It's something that combines both the good things of C/C++ and the Node.js/Typescript environments.11:["$","$L12",null,{"locale":"en","now":"$D2025-01-11T14:55:00.790Z","timeZone":"Europe/Paris","messages":{"not_found_page":{"description":"Page not found :/"},"navbar":{"musics_lbl":"Musics","devinfos_lbl":"Coding","contacts_lbl":"Contacts","legals_lbl":"Legals"},"home":{"welcome":"Hi everybody !\nWelcome to my personal page !\n♥ :3 ♥","main_intro":"I would say that I have 2 (okay ... maybe 3) main passions.\nFirst one is music ♫♪\nSecond one is coding and creating apps like this website for example !\n(Third one is video-games but I won't talk about that particulary here)","musics_infos":"Soooo ...\nMy first passion is music and I love to produce ♥\nYou can find my artist profile under the nickname 'Ilohama' on different streaming platforms.\nClick on the button right below for the links !","music_link":"My Music Page","dev_infos":"And my second passion is programming and computer sciences.\nI have studied and worked in this field.\nI'll let you learn more on this by clicking on the button below !","dev_link":"My Devs Infos"},"musics":{"header":"My Music","desc":"Here's a list of links to my profile pages on different streaming platforms ...\nChoose the one you're the most used to :>","releases_lbl":"My Releases"},"dev_infos":{"header":"My Dev Journey","grades":{"lbl":"Studies & Graduations","beginning_lbl":"The Beginning","beginning_desc":"As far as I remember, ever since I was young I would disassemble electronic devices to see all the little pieces and was constantly asking myself : \"How does this work ?\".\nSo, when it came as a class in school, I naturally jumped to study Electronic Science and finally understand everything I had been questioning.

So I went to a college for 2 years, but I still wasn't satisfied with what I knew.

I worked there for three years (from 2019 to 2022) and did learned a lot. I joined a team to create a new product that was combining multiple technologies.\nTo build that up, we set up Git for managing our codebase. As we were working in both Linux and Windows environments (Linux for the embedded part and Windows for the client part), we decided to use VS Code as it is cross-platform and allows a lot of flexibility.\nMy main job in all of this was to create a container for the data of the embedded device and be able to read it in a Player. I used to code the container with C/C++ in combination of gStreamer for data flow. Then, to display them to the final consumer, the player used Node.Js and electron/Vue.Js for creating the GUI. I had to create a binding between my container and the Vue.Js display using gStreamer and Node.Js native bindings."},"freetime":{"lbl":"Free time","desc":"$13"},"resume":{"lbl":"Resume","desc":"Download my french resume"}},"contacts":{"socials_lbl":"Socials"},"legals":{"header":"Legals","easyreading_desc":"If you had a great experience while reading with the main font, think about taking a look at the official website !","reacticons_desc":"All the icons came from 'React-Icons' lib.","augmentedui_desc":"To get this 'Cyberpunky' effect (?), I used augmented-ui !","keiex_desc":"♥ ♥ And finally, A special thanks to KeiEx for providing me the Avatar ! ♥ ♥"}},"children":["$","div",null,{"id":"root","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"page_container","data-augmented-ui":true,"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"SlowParticles_slow_particle_container__H4ENv","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"SlowParticles_circle_container__jGOCx","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"SlowParticles_circle__n8B44"}]}],["$","div","1",{"className":"SlowParticles_circle_container__jGOCx","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"SlowParticles_circle__n8B44"}]}],["$","div","2",{"className":"SlowParticles_circle_container__jGOCx","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"SlowParticles_circle__n8B44"}]}],["$","div","3",{"className":"SlowParticles_circle_container__jGOCx","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"SlowParticles_circle__n8B44"}]}],["$","div","4",{"className":"SlowParticles_circle_container__jGOCx","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"SlowParticles_circle__n8B44"}]}],["$","div","5",{"className":"SlowParticles_circle_container__jGOCx","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"SlowParticles_circle__n8B44"}]}],["$","div","6",{"className":"SlowParticles_circle_container__jGOCx","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"SlowParticles_circle__n8B44"}]}]]}],["$","$L14",null,{"locale":"fr"}],["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","$0:f:0:1:2:children:0","children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[],["$","main",null,{"className":"page_content_container","children":["$","p",null,{"children":"Page not found :/"}]}]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}]}]}]
