I was constantly asking myself : \"How does all of this work ?\".\nSo, when it cames as a school lessons, I naturally jumped on the occasion to do some studies to finally understand it. I pushed it to the high school diploma in electronic sciences achieved in 2012.",
      "revelation_lbl": "The Revelation",
      "revelation_desc": "During the electronic school curriculum, I discovered coding with a project that was lighting up an LED reacting to a sound input. To be honest, at the start, I was bored to tell everything to the computer ... But I slowly falls into love with it. I was loving the fact that I was able to write things that takes 'life' on a computer. And then, it was it, I had to learn more on computer sciences.",

      "pursuit_desc": "At the time I ended high school, I needed some lessons but with a lot of practice. So, I looked at and follow a first formation in 2 years. Out of this one, I felt unsatisfied on how much I learned. So, I decided to push to a bachelor's degree and then to a master degree in computer sciences that ends up in 2019 at the University 'Université Sciences et Techniques' of Besançon (25000, France)."

I joined a team to create a new product that was combining multiple technologies.\nTo build that up, we set up Git for managing our codebase. As we were working in both Linux and Windows environments (Linux for the embedded part and Windows for the client part), we decided to use VS Code as it is cross-plateform and allows a lot of flexibility.\nMy main job in all of this was to create a container for the datas of the embedded device and be able to read it in a Player. I used to code the container with C/C++ in combination of gStreamer for datas flow. Then, to display them to the final consumer, the player used Node.Js and electron/Vue.Js for creating the GUI. I had to create a binding between my container and the Vue.Js display using gStreamer and Node.Js native bindings."

      "desc": "Well, on my free time, I still use to do some coding sometimes. I still use VS Code as my editor in heart and save (... sometimes ...) my differents tests and searchs on Github or on a private GitLab.\nFor example, you can access all the codebase of this website on my Github page ! It is writen in React.js with a combination of HTML/SCSS/Typescript and uses Node.Js to build and publish everything.\nBack in the days, I used to participate in Global Game Jam from 2015 to 2020 with friends. Nowadays, I have a focus on the Zig language that I liked a lot at firsts use. Sooo, I decided to build my own 2D game engine following a YouTube series as a way to learn more on how it works. The original series is written with Java but I try to recreate it all in Zig as a practice exercise. I might publish it on GitHub one day ...\nA brief word on Zig : for now, I'm in love with it ! Why ? Because it is cross-platform, compiles against C/C++, is pretty lightweight keywords that makes it easy to understand what is going on, and works pretty good for a still in development language ! If I had to describe it, it's a language that combines both good things of C/C++ and Node.Js/Typescript environments."
